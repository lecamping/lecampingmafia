LeCamping Mafia
===============

A list of all startups from [LeCamping](http://accelerate.numaparis.com/), the 1st startup accelerator in France.

How to add content
------------------

Startups data is stored into the [`startup.json`](https://github.com/lecamping/lecampingmafia/blob/gh-pages/startups.json) file. You can simply [edit it from the GitHub website](https://github.com/lecamping/lecampingmafia/edit/gh-pages/startups.json), you will only need a GitHub account. If you are not part of the Mafia (the editorial team), then you will create a GitHub Pull Request and someone from the Mafia will need to merge it. Be careful to write valid JSON.

Note: the favicon is retrieved using http://g.etfv.co/. If your favicon doesn't appear, check directly with http:/g.etfv.co/http://your.website.com 

How to improve the website
--------------------------

The website is a simple client-side [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web application. You just need a browser to run it. It is build on a very small Modele View Controller architecture.

Kepp It Simple Stupid please.
